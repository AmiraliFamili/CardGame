In our first meeting we discussed for 1 hour regarding how to approach the game so that it would run with a round robin fashion 
after we started to work on the code separately we noticed that we should make the project in a way that players play the game 
simultaneously (in parallel) therefore we should have made a thread for each player and communicate among them ... 


what strategy we used for development : navigator / driver -> V model 
-- problem with synchronization and parallel : if everything is in a synchronized block is it running in parallel ? 
-- problem with round robin : how can players play simultaneously and the game is played in round robin fashion 
-- can we only use threads to make the project run in round robin ? 
-- what time slice should we use to avoid slow programs and avoid collisions 
-- why V model ?
