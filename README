# Guide to Unite test of the MultiThreaded Card Game

- All the relevant files regarding the test are in this directory (test) : 
    total of 7 files and 1 directory including this file 

    1. lib directory : 
        jar files for Junit 4 and all relevant libraries required for the tests are stored in this directory (or jar files in the directory).
    2. testRunner.java : 
        the main class which should be used to run the tests with simply running the main.
        it should print (All tests passed: true) which indicates that all tests in different test files passed successfully.
    3. testCard.java : 
        contains all the test methods for methods which are present in the card class (Card.java) 
    4. testPlayer.java : 
        contains all the test methods for methods which are present in the player class (Player.java)
    5. testInputOutput.java : 
        contains ... 
    6. testCardGame : 
        contains all the tests regarding the builder methods which majorly distribute the cards in the pack between players and decks and passes them to their relevant classes, it's also testing the main game method which threads are playing in.
    7. READMRE :
        this file ... contains information on how to run the tests and what test suites we have.
    8. mockPack.txt :
        is a simulated pack used for testing the InputOutput Class in testInputOutput.java


        # Instructions 

    - After the cardsTest.zip is unzipped copy all the content in the test directory and 
        paste them in the same directory as the source code.

    - Then simply run the main method within the testRunner.java which runs all the test suits. 

        # Notes 

    - Objects used for development and/or implementation of the game have not been tested 
        with their individual test methods, Instead they are tested throughout the test classes within each test method (testing their functionality whilst using them), they have been used as mock objects. 
    - these tests should be in the exact location of the source code in order to be executed, they also rely on the players and decks       
        directories to write players and decks information to their relevant files.
