Developer, Role, duration, Date & Time, Description         

Amirali, Designer, 2hrs,  2023/10/28 - 13:00 to 15:00, read through the specification and came up with the 
    main methods to implement, the overall structure of the game and wrote a method for generating pack 

Amirali, Developer/Designer, 5hrs, 2023/10/30 - 16:30 to 21:30,  after I had my first meeting with Kaylum
    I created this git repository, log sheet, specification of what each of use should do, finished the methods
    for creating pack, hands and decks and a little of the main game's method. 

Amirali, Developer, 2hrs, 2023/10/31 - 10:00 to 12:00, I started working on the main game's methods and 
    finished the main game, so you can play it now.

Amirali, Designer/Developer, 1.5hrs, 2023/10/31 - 12:00 to 13:30, the game is now running in parallel and each player 
    have their own thread and i made some synchronized blocks to avoid race conditions, i also created a report Content file 
    to remind us that we should start working on the report at the same time , also did a little commenting 

kaylum, 1.5h, 2023/10/31 - 20:00 - 21:30, after my second meeting with Amirali and where he showed me the code and and explained his part, 
    i spend an hour and a hald trying to undertstand the code that night before trying to undertsand how to implement the work and coming up with ideas
    how to do so.

kaylum, 4h, 2023/11/01 - 10:00 - 14:00, i tried spend the hours working on output files where the code would output the work into
    a seperate txt output file, though i got a bit stuck on getting the code tow ork with the rest of the code outside of the Player.Java
    ive also added a folder output/test/ where all 'txt' file shoud be added from the player.java

Amirali, Designer, 1.5hrs, 2023/11/03 - 15:00 to 16:30, I have worked on the structure of the code and placed the relevant methods 
    in their own classes and I worked on the multi threading problem and found a solution to use threadpool

Amirali, Developer, 1.5hrs, 2023/11/04 - 15:00 to 18:00, I worked no the threads of players and managed to make a system where players are playing independently
    and are playing in their own threads, the program can be considered thread safe but there is a small problem with the left and right deck they are not being updated 
    properly so changing the structure of the game might be the solution.


Amirali, Developer, 0.5hrs, 2023/11/05 - 18:00 to 18:30, worked on the game method and found the problem of the code.

Amirali, Developer, 1.5hrs, 2023/11/05 - 12:45 to 14:15, fixed the decks problem and finished making the game in parallel and worked on synchronization


kaylum, 2h, 2023/11/05 - 19:00-21:00, after having spending a couple days away from the work i have come back in and got aqaunated with teh work

kaylum 2h, 2023/11/05 - 22:00-24:00,  seeing that threads have been added i did some reserach on it spend some time researching threads and best 
    implement them into the work of player.java and have annoted the place where it hsould be implemented, ive additonly wriiten on the developer.txt
    where i have complted the task needed

kaylum 8h, 2023/11/07 - 9:30-17:30, spend a few hours implmenting the player.java and spending hours trying to undertsand the other code and how the 
    methods work so when i call on the methods in the player class they will work

kaylum, 5h, 2023/11/08 - 15:00-18:00, stuggled with the impkmentation and spent a few hours trying to resolve some major problem that would affcet the game to complie
