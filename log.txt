Developer, Role, duration, Date & Time, Description         

Amirali, Designer, 2hrs,  2023/10/28 - 13:00 to 15:00, read through the specification and came up with the 
    main methods to implement, the overall structure of the game and wrote a method for generating pack 

Amirali, Developer/Designer, 5hrs, 2023/10/30 - 16:30 to 21:30,  after I had my first meeting with Kaylum
    I created this git repository, log sheet, specification of what each of use should do, finished the methods
    for creating pack, hands and decks and a little of the main game's method. 

Amirali, Developer, 2hrs, 2023/10/31 - 10:00 to 12:00, I started working on the main game's methods and 
    finished the main game, so you can play it now.

Amirali, Designer/Developer, 1.5hrs, 2023/10/31 - 12:00 to 13:30, the game is now running in parallel and each player 
    have their own thread and i made some synchronized blocks to avoid race conditions, i also created a report Content file 
    to remind us that we should start working on the report at the same time , also did a little commenting 

Amirali, Designer, 1.5hrs, 2023/11/03 - 15:00 to 16:30, I have worked on the structure of the code and placed the relevant methods 
    in their own classes and I worked on the multi threading problem and found a solution to use threadpool

Amirali, Developer, 1.5hrs, 2023/11/04 - 15:00 to 18:00, I worked no the threads of players and managed to make a system where players are playing independently
    and are playing in their own threads, the program can be considered thread safe but there is a small problem with the left and right deck they are not being updated 
    properly so changing the structure of the game might be the solution.
