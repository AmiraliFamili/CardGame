Amirali : 
    - report : write logs 
    - update the current tests and write the test for the two new classes 
    - documentation of the rest of the code and updating the current ones 
    - main game method changes : deck operations to their class, player constructor to methods

Jamie : 
    - better design for the code 
    - using design patterns for the code 
    - better structure for the code 
    - if any bugs found whilst running the game in your machine (it works on my mac i don't know if you have any other laptop or pc)
