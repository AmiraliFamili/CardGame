Amirali : 
    1. how can we make use of threads and wait/sleep method to implement the round robin fashion 
    2. give better structure to the methods created so far 
    3. map the relevant methods to their classes and find a way to pass the pack !
    4. 

Kaylum : 
    1. input and output files with use of threads 
    2. read the code and try to understand 
    3. when you finish your work please push it through github and write down how long you were working on 
        the code / structure of it and write a small description about the specific work below your log 
        You can check out my example in log.txt file and follow the same format 
    4. get familiar with use of threads we should make the hole project synchronized once we are finished 

    Notes for Kaylum : i have made all methods inside the card.java which is incorrect they should be in their 
        relevant classes , in our next meeting we should talk about how we can make use of the round robin fashion 
        , please finish the tasks I mentioned above before 12 
        if you couldn't get them to finish before that time that's fine too but we should have a meeting soon. 


meeting content : we should pay more attention to the report part and in regards, we should start taking about how we can design 
the code and the overall structure of it better and thoroughly, we should make notes of our meetings and use it as report material
